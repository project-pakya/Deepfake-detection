Deepfake videos, generated through advanced artificial intelligence, have raised significant
concerns in areas such as social media, security, and entertainment. Detecting such fake
videos is crucial for safeguarding the authenticity of media. This project investigates the
performance of three deep learning models—MobileNet V3, Multi-Scale Vision Transformer
(MS-ViT), and EfficientNet—in detecting deepfake videos. The models are tested on the
Celeb-DF V2 dataset, which contains real and fake videos sourced from various celebrity
videos. This study compares the strengths and weaknesses of each model, aiming to propose
a scalable, accurate, and efficient solution for deepfake detection.
